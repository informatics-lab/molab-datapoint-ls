Staying drier in the east and south-east, where some cold nights remain possible. Similar conditions are likely as we move through into the first week of February. Bands of rain will probably cross the country, interspersed with brighter and showery interludes. Windy at times, with gales likely in the northwest. The heaviest rain is also likely across northern and western parts. Temperatures are likely to be mild into the start of February, however there is a chance that the southeast may be drier and colder at times."

This would bring gales at times, especially in the northwest. Temperatures are likely to be slightly above normal for the time of year. South-eastern parts may well stay drier and brighter. From the middle of February, confidence in the forecast reduces but there is a possibility that high pressure will return, bringing more settled weather with lighter winds. As a result, temperatures may become colder at times, with overnight frost and fog again possible."
